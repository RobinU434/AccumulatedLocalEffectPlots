# AccumulatedLocalEffectPlots
This repository is part of the "Fair and Interpretable Machine Learning" seminar hosted by Janek Thomas in the summer semester 2022. This codebase will contain a personal custom implementation of accumulated effect plots.
 
I will use out of the box ML algorithms to generate models to apply the presented interpretability technique. 

For initialization you can download the required datasets with the provided script.
